        <H1 ALIGN="center">GAME PURPOSE:</H1>
		<b>How is it played?</b>
		<p>The beergame simulates a four stage supply chain (retailer, wholesaler, distributer and factory). Each stage is played by one or better two or three players.</p>
		<p>A supply chain is typically played by 8 to 12 people; more than one supply chain can be administered in one class at the same time.</p>
		<b>The task</b>
		<p>The task of each supply chain is to produce and deliver units of beer: the factory produces and the other three stages deliver the beer units until it reaches </p>
		<p>the external customer at the downstream end of the supply chain.</p>
		<p>The aim of the players is rather simple: each sub group has to fulfil the incoming orders of beer.</p>
		<b>Structural setup</b>
		<p>Orders flow upstream, while deliveries flow downstream in the supply chain (see figure 1).</p>
		<p>An important structural aspect is delay (i.e. time lag) in order to account for logistics and production time. Each delivery (and production order) requires two </p>
		<p>rounds until they are finally delivered to the next stage.</p>
		<p>In the structural setup this is represented by two shipping delay fields located in between the supply chain stages as well as at the production end.</p>
		<b>Playing the game</b>
		<p>The game is played in rounds, which simulates weeks.</p>
		<p>Using the materials provided on the table (see figure 2), players have to carry out the following steps in each round:</p>
		<p>1.	receive incoming orders</p>
		<p>2.	receive incoming deliveries</p>
		<p>3.	update play sheets (outstanding deliveries and inventory)</p>
		<p>4.	send out deliveries, and finally</p>
		<p>5.	decide on the amount to be ordered</p>
		<p>Deciding on each round’s order amount is effectively the only decision that players are able to make throughout the game.</p>
		<b>Essential rules</b>
		<p>Every order has to be fulfilled, either directly (should the players’ inventory be large enough) or later in subsequent rounds.</p>
		<p>Inventory and backlog incur cost – each item in stock costs EUR 0.50 per week, while each item on backlog costs EUR 1.00. Consequently, the primary aim of each </p>
		<p>subgroup is to keep their costs low.</p>
		<p>Hence, the optimal strategy for the players is to run their business with as little stock as possible without being forced to “move into backorder”.</p>
		<p>Players are not allowed to communicate. The only information they are allowed to exchange is the order amount; there is no transparency as to what stock levels or </p>
		<p>actual customer demand is; only the retailer knows the external demand.</p>
		<b>Customer demand</b>
		<p>The external demand is predetermined and usually does not vary greatly.</p>
		<p>In the beginning, the supply chain is pre-initialised with inventory levels (e.g. 15 units), orders (e.g. 5 units) and beer units in the shipping delay fields (e.g. 5 units).</p>
		<p>In order to induce the bullwhip effect, the external demand remains stable for a few rounds (e.g. 5 units for 5 rounds) before it suddenly shows one steep increase (jumps to 9 units) </p>
		<p>before it remains stable again at this higher level for the remainder of the game (usually 40 to 50 rounds in total).</p>
		<p>The one increase in external demand inevitably leads to the creation of the bullwhip effect and to a destabilisation of ordering patterns throughout the supply chain.</p>
