The Files needed to check the inventory are implemented by Benjamin Lentz.
The HTML-file checkinventory.html inlcudes a form which provides a identification for gain acess to the wanted information. The javascript in this file ables the form to check if the identification input are valid data.
The java files ensures that the wanted information are extracted from the data base(not implemented yet) and displays it in a table.
