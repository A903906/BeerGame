My .html , .java and .js are:

MakeComment.html
login.html
PostComments.java
ShowCommentsDataBase.java
login.java
register.java

In MakeComment.html the  text box changes its size while you are writing and if you click on the submit 
button without filling the text box an alert appears. In our game it will be impossible to make a comment without
login so I didn't put a restriction to that and if you aren't registered it gives you an error.

In the ShowCommentsDataBase.java something similar will happen. This forum will only be available when the game
is finished so it is mandatory to be registered. In the other hand, as the user is also shown in the table I had 
to include the login.java and the register.java. 
In ShowComments.java I used javascript to give "likes" to the comments and to show and alert when the page 
loads.

With the menu, shown at the top of each page, you can access to each of this functions.
