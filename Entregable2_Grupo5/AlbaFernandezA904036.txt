My .java and .js files are:
Group.java 
Graph.java


Group.java is a first screen that helps to know the group name as we haven´t developed all the functions yet. 
That´s why it doesn´t have the css because we won´t use it at the end. 
To make sure that it works, you have to insert "Tecnun" as it´s the only group available in the data base. 



Graph.java uses a javascript to draw the different graphs. It takes the information from the database according to the day, player and group.
